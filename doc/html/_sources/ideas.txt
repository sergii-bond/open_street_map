Other ideas about the datasets
-------------------------------------

* Find more information about fields. For instance:
    * information about *addr:interpolation* field can be found `here <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Addresses#Using_interpolation>`_. 
    * see how *addr:interpolation_1*  can interpreted.
    * understand what does *addr:street_1* designates.
* Resolve entities. It is likely several fields in the current solution mean the same thing, for example, *shop*, *shop_1* and *shop_2*.
* Process other unique keys that have one or more columns (:) in them, convert them to a better schema.
* Audit the values
    * See whether any values contain information that can be extracted as a new field (we have seen this in wikipedia's value already). Clean up if the pattern can be discovered.
    * Check consistency, for example of units. 
* Process documents of type *relations* to get more data about the city into the database
* After the better schema is in place and the understanding of the fields meaning is clear, more sophisticated queries can be run to answer many questions about the city.
* Provisions should be made on updating the database periodically with new data coming from Open Street Map. If possible, find a way to do it incrementally, without a need to completely write the data from scratch.
